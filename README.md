# Week 1 Exercise Repository

This repository is a comprehensive collection of exercises and projects that were completed as part of Week 1 in the DN 3.0. The exercises span a variety of topics, including data structures and algorithms (DSA), design patterns, and practical Java applications. Each project is designed to reinforce key concepts and provide hands-on experience in software development.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

A significant portion of this repository focuses on implementing various data structures and algorithms in Java. These exercises are structured around real-world scenarios, such as managing an e-commerce platform, an employee management system, financial forecasting, and more. Each project is designed to explore different aspects of DSA, from searching algorithms like binary and linear search to more complex system management like inventory and library management.

For instance, the `EcommercePlatform` project demonstrates how binary and linear search algorithms can be applied to find products within a catalog. Similarly, the `EmployeeManagementSystem` provides insights into organizing and retrieving employee data efficiently. These exercises not only help in understanding the theoretical aspects of algorithms but also in applying them to practical, everyday programming tasks.

## Design Patterns

The repository also includes several examples of design patterns, which are crucial for writing clean, efficient, and reusable code. Each design pattern is explored through a dedicated project. For example, the `ObserverPatternExample` project simulates a stock market where different observers (like web apps) react to changes in stock prices. The `ProxyPatternExample` and `SingletonPatternExample` demonstrate how to manage object creation and control access to resources in a system.

These design pattern examples are written in a way that emphasizes their practical use cases, making it easier to grasp their significance in software design and architecture. Whether you’re new to design patterns or looking to reinforce your understanding, these examples serve as a solid foundation.
 

# Week 2 Exercise Repository

Welcome to the Week 2 Exercise Repository! This collection of files is part of my coursework, where I delved into both Java-based web development and PL/SQL scripting. The repository is divided into two main sections: a Maven-based Library Management System and a series of PL/SQL scripts.

## Library Management System Projects

In this repository, two versions of a Library Management System project is here. Both versions are developed using Java, but each version reflects different stages of the project, showcasing the evolution of the system.

The more recent version in the `LibraryManagement 9` folder, is built using Spring Boot, a powerful framework that simplifies the development of Java applications. This project manages the basic operations of a library, such as adding new books, retrieving book information, updating details, and removing books. The structure includes a variety of Java files organized into controllers, services, and repositories. Additionally, it utilizes Maven for dependency management, ensuring that all necessary libraries are included and up-to-date. If you're familiar with Java and Spring Boot, this project should be straightforward to understand and run.

The earlier version of the project, located in the `LibraryManagement-8` folder, has a similar purpose but a slightly different structure and implementation. This version might be interesting if you're curious to see how the project has progressed and refined over time.

## PL/SQL Scripts

The second part of this repository is a collection of PL/SQL scripts. These scripts are designed to perform various database operations, demonstrating control structures, cursor handling, error management, and more. They also include practical examples such as stored procedures, triggers, and functions, which are essential for managing and manipulating data within a database. For anyone working with Oracle databases or interested in learning PL/SQL, these scripts provide a valuable resource.

In addition to the scripts, there’s a document (`Week 2_PLSQL.docx`) that provides further explanations and context, making it easier to understand the purpose and usage of each script.
